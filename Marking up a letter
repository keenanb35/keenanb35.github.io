  <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

  <p>Dear <strong>Eileen</strong>,</p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
    Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your
    <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year.
    I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
  </p>

  <h2>Starting dates</h2>

  <p>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
    however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
    semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
    <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
    <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Please let me know if this is <em>acceptable</em>, and if so which start date
    you would <strong>prefer</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

  <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
    facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
    and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
    just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the ideas you submitted, we were most intrigued by the following, in
    order of priority:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
      (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
    </li>
    <li>
      Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures
      exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
      (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>)
    </li>
    <li>
      <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
      <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing
      musical scores
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Please provide more information on each of these subjects, including
    expected duration, required staff, and other resources needed.
    <em>Thank you.</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

  <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic
    tribal dances. My favorite dances are as follows:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>
      A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as
      300 <abbr title="Before Common Era">BCE</abbr>.
    </dd>

    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>
      A dance involving huddling together and shuffling in tiny, rapid
      movements, believed by some to have inspired modern styles such as
      <em>Twerking</em>.
    </dd>

    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>
      A misinterpreted movement style observed by English explorers in the
      1960s, later discovered to be a response to extreme cold.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p>
